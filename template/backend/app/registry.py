"""__NAME__ feature-module registry.

The edge base (auth, branding, license, messaging, reports, system, audit, ...) is
always mounted by create_base_app. Register this scenario's OWN feature modules here
as they are built — each a self-contained package under app/modules/<id>/ with a
ModuleSpec — which the license then enables/disables per client.
